# PyGOP: A Python library for Generalized Operational Perceptron (GOP) based algorithms
This package implements progressive learning algorithms using `Generalized Operational Perceptron <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231216312851>`_. This implementation includes the following algorithms: Progressive Operational Perceptron (POP); Heterogeneous Multilayer Generalized Operational Perceptron (HeMLGOP) and its variants; Fast Progressive Operational Perceptron (POPfast) and Progressive Operational Perceptron with Memory (POPmemO, POPmemH)
